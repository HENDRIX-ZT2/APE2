# APE2
Utility program to code new content for Zoo Tycoon 2, similar to the official Animal Project Editor for Zoo Tycoon 1.


### Installation
You need to have installed:
- python 3.6 (make sure you add it to your system path during installation)
- requests
- bs4 (beautifulsoup4)

Install the missing dependencies with python's package manager, `pip` (eg. in the Windows commandline, type `pip install requests`).

Click the `Clone or Download` button at the right, then `Download ZIP`. Unzip to a folder of your choice. Assuming you have python configured as an environment variable, run the program by double clicking on `run.bat` (a shortcut for typing `python ape2.py` in a console window.
